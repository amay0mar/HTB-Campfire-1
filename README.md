# HTB-Campfire-1



<h2>Description</h2>
The HackTheBox Sherlock (Campfire-1) machine simulates a real-world investigation scenario where users must analyze logs and events to uncover malicious activity within a compromised environment. Solving it using Splunk provided a streamlined and efficient approach to threat hunting, leveraging powerful search queries, field extractions, and visualizations to quickly correlate events, identify suspicious behavior, and trace the attackerâ€™s actions across the network. Compared to manual log review or basic command-line tools, Splunk significantly reduced investigation time and improved accuracy through its centralized, intuitive interface and advanced filtering capabilities.

Now back to Ubuntu Installer we are going to change the interface from DHCPv4 to Manual or static: <br/>
Now got back to Network Connections > drop down to "ens33 eth" and select "edit IPv4" > after that select "Manual" > now a window has appeared and just plug in the required IP from our previous steps <br/>
